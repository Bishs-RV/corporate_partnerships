The master bedroom includes a <strong>king bed slide out</strong> with USB ports on either side of the bed so you both can charge your phones, and there is a dresser for your folded clothes. You will love the front bathroom with <strong>dual bath sinks</strong>, a fiberglass one-piece shower, plus a walk-in closet with shelves and rods to hang clothes! There is a <strong>unique middle utility room</strong> with washer and dryer prep if you want to add these, a Washer and dryer counter and a rod to hang clothes that will make a perfect laundry room, or you can utilize this space for storage! Head to the main living area to relax on the theater seating or hide-a-bed sofa, and if you have guests stay over, they can sleep here. There is also an entertainment center with a 50\" flat screen TV, but you might just leave that off if you're working at the <strong>desk with a chair</strong> that is provided. We've saved the best part for last, the kitchen! Here, you'll find ample counter space to prep home-cooked meals, a three-burner range with a 24\" oven, plus a large <strong>counter with barstools</strong> where you can enjoy breakfast at each morning.

With an <strong>electric leveling system</strong>, you can set your unit up quick and easy then get to having fun faster than ever. The cambered powder coated frame with rust prohibitor construction allows for more duration of the fifth wheel. Each model also comes with a TV antenna with booster, 60,000BTU <strong>on demand tankless water heater</strong>, Goodyear Radial tires with 7,000 lb. axles, and the list goes on.

Dinette</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Camping in the woods is just what the doctor ordered and this trailer will provide all the interior comforts you need! There is a three burner cooktop and a<strong> microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals each day, plus an 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator for cold items. After your meal is made, you can dine at the booth dinette or relax on the <strong>jack-knife sofa</strong>, and these areas can become sleeping space for two to three guests at night. The full bath with a <strong>tub/shower</strong> means you won't have to use the camp's facilities and the <strong>16' power awning</strong> will provide protection from the sun as you visit with other campers!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, marine grade exterior speakers, and an on-demand <strong>tankless water heater.</strong> </p>","globalUniqueId": "1UJBC0BL4S1YZ0670","salesPitch": "No Fees, We Will Beat Any Price..

Experience</strong></h1> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Go Lite Skybreaker 12 travel trailer offers the functionality of a full-size RV in a lightweight, compact design that’s easy to tow with an SUV. It’s an excellent choice for adventurers who want to explore the great outdoors without upgrading their vehicle or dealing with the challenges of towing a large camper.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <h2 style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Key Features of the Go Lite Skybreaker 12</h2> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Spacious Interior:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Go Lite Skybreaker 12 may be compact, but it’s loaded with features you'd expect in a much larger trailer. It comes equipped with a full kitchen, a dinette, a dry bath, a bunk bed, and a tent bed—providing three separate sleeping areas. You'll also enjoy tons of storage and panoramic windows that keep you connected to the great outdoors. It’s an awesome little model built for big adventures.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Lightweight and Easy to Tow:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">With a <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">UVW of just 2,300 pounds</strong>, the Go Lite is exceptionally lightweight, making it towable by smaller vehicles like SUVs, compact trucks, and some capable minivans. With an <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">exterior length of only 13'10\"</strong>, its compact design allows you to access tight camping spots that larger RVs simply can’t reach.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Full Kitchen:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Go Lite’s kitchen is thoughtfully designed to bring the comforts of home on the road. It features an <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">4.4-cubic-foot refrigerator and freezer</strong>, a full-sized <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">residential farmhouse sink</strong>, a microwave, and a 2-burner stove, making cooking easy and enjoyable.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Adventure-Ready Design:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Built on a<strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> custom chassis</strong> tailored to its floorplan, the Go Lite Skybreaker 12 offers extra support where it’s needed most. With an <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">adjustable axle and heavy-duty off-road tires</strong>, this trailer is ready to take on rugged terrain and go wherever your adventures lead.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <h2 style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Why Choose Go Lite?</h2> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Go Lite redefines lightweight travel trailers, making adventure accessible to everyone. Weighing as little as 2,000 pounds, Go Lite trailers <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">can be towed by most SUVs, V6 vehicles, and even minivans</strong>. Unlike other compact RVs, Go Lite combines affordability and functionality with essential features like a full kitchen, bathroom, and smart storage solutions. With Go Lite, you can embark on every adventure without compromise.</p>","globalUniqueId": "7J3U1EB18SL014422","systemCreateDate": "11/01/2025 20:04:00","systemModifyDate": "12/05/2025

design that’s easy to tow with an SUV. It’s an excellent choice for adventurers who want to explore the great outdoors without upgrading their vehicle or dealing with the challenges of towing a large camper.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <h2 style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Key Features of the Go Lite Skybreaker 12</h2> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Spacious Interior:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Go Lite Skybreaker 12 may be compact, but it’s loaded with features you'd expect in a much larger trailer.

Skybreaker 12 travel trailer offers the functionality of a full-size RV in a lightweight, compact design that’s easy to tow with an SUV. It’s an excellent choice for adventurers who want to explore the great outdoors without upgrading their vehicle or dealing with the challenges of towing a large camper.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <h2 style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Key Features of the Go Lite Skybreaker 12</h2> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Spacious Interior:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Go Lite Skybreaker 12 may be compact, but it’s loaded with features you'd expect in a much larger trailer. It comes equipped with a full kitchen, a dinette, a dry bath, a bunk bed, and a tent bed—providing three separate sleeping areas. You'll also enjoy tons of storage and panoramic windows that keep you connected to the great outdoors. It’s an awesome little model built for big adventures.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Lightweight and Easy to Tow:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">With a <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">UVW of just 2,300 pounds</strong>, the Go Lite is exceptionally lightweight, making it towable by smaller vehicles like SUVs, compact trucks, and some capable minivans. With an <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">exterior length of only 13'10\"</strong>, its compact design allows you to access tight camping spots that larger RVs simply can’t reach.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Full Kitchen:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Go Lite’s kitchen is thoughtfully designed to bring the comforts of home on the road. It features an <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">4.4-cubic-foot refrigerator and freezer</strong>, a full-sized <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">residential farmhouse sink</strong>, a microwave, and a 2-burner stove, making cooking easy and enjoyable.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Adventure-Ready Design:</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Built on a<strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> custom chassis</strong> tailored to its floorplan, the Go Lite Skybreaker 12 offers extra support where it’s needed most. With an <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">adjustable axle and heavy-duty off-road tires</strong>, this trailer is ready to take on rugged terrain and go wherever your adventures lead.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p> <h2 style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Why Choose Go Lite?</h2> <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Go Lite redefines lightweight travel trailers, making adventure accessible to everyone. Weighing as little as 2,000 pounds, Go Lite trailers <strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">can be towed by most SUVs, V6 vehicles, and even minivans</strong>. Unlike other compact RVs, Go Lite combines affordability and functionality with essential features like a full kitchen, bathroom, and smart storage solutions. With Go Lite, you can embark on every adventure without compromise.</p>","globalUniqueId": "7J3U1EB19SL050166","salesPitch": "SUV towable and jam packed with features of a bigger trailer.

the doctor ordered and this trailer will provide all the interior comforts you need! There is a three burner cooktop and a<strong> microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals each day, plus an 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator for cold items. After your meal is made, you can dine at the booth dinette or relax on the <strong>jack-knife sofa</strong>, and these areas can become sleeping space for two to three guests at night. The full bath with a <strong>tub/shower</strong> means you won't have to use the camp's facilities and the <strong>16' power awning</strong> will provide protection from the sun as you visit with other campers!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, marine grade exterior speakers, and an on-demand <strong>tankless water heater.</strong> </p>","globalUniqueId": "1UJBC0BL9S1YZ0843","salesPitch": "No Fees, We Will Beat Any Price..

There is a three burner cooktop and a<strong> microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals each day, plus an 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator for cold items. After your meal is made, you can dine at the booth dinette or relax on the <strong>jack-knife sofa</strong>, and these areas can become sleeping space for two to three guests at night. The full bath with a <strong>shower</strong> means you won't have to use the camp's facilities and the <strong>16' power awning</strong> will provide protection from the sun as you visit with other campers!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, and an on-demand <strong>tankless water heater.</strong> </p>","globalUniqueId": "1UJBC0BL6T16L0191","salesPitch": "No Fees, We Will Beat Any Price..

bedroom, plus the booth dinette and jack-knife sofa in the main living area! The chef of your crew will have a three burner cooktop and <strong>microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals, and everyone can store their favorite drinks in the 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator inside, or in the outdoor refrigerator for convenience. The rear corner bathroom includes a shower and a toilet, with the sink just outside of this room so others can brush their teeth if one is taking a shower before bed. The <strong>outside storage</strong> is accessible on both sides of the unit and will easily allow you bring along camp chairs, yard games and more.  A 16' powered awning with LED lights will create a nice place to gather in the evenings with family and friends!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, and an on-demand <strong>tankless water heater.</strong> </p>","globalUniqueId": "1UJBC0BP7T16X0332","salesPitch": "No Fees, We Will Beat Any Price..

The chef of your crew will have a three burner cooktop and <strong>microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals, and everyone can store their favorite drinks in the 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator. The bathroom includes a shower and a toilet, with the sink just outside of this room so others can brush their teeth if one is taking a shower before bed. The <strong>outside storage</strong> will let you bring along fishing poles and the 16' power awning with LED lights will create a nice place to gather in the evenings!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, and an on-demand <strong>tankless water heater</strong>. </p>","globalUniqueId": "1UJBC0BN3T16U0355","salesPitch": "No Fees, We Will Beat Any Price..

front bedroom, plus the booth dinette and jack-knife sofa in the main living area! The chef of your crew will have a three burner cooktop and <strong>microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals, and everyone can store their favorite drinks in the 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator inside, or in the outdoor refrigerator for convenience. The rear corner bathroom includes a shower and a toilet, with the sink just outside of this room so others can brush their teeth if one is taking a shower before bed. The <strong>outside storage</strong> is accessible on both sides of the unit and will easily allow you bring along camp chairs, yard games and more.  A 16' powered awning with LED lights will create a nice place to gather in the evenings with family and friends!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, and an on-demand <strong>tankless water heater.</strong> </p>","globalUniqueId": "1UJBC0BP5T16X0331","salesPitch": "No Fees, We Will Beat Any Price..

The chef of your crew will have a three burner cooktop and <strong>microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals, and everyone can store their favorite drinks in the 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator. The bathroom includes a shower and a toilet, with the sink just outside of this room so others can brush their teeth if one is taking a shower before bed. The <strong>outside storage</strong> will let you bring along fishing poles and the 16' power awning with LED lights will create a nice place to gather in the evenings!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect.

Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep,</strong> Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, and an on-demand <strong>tankless water heater</strong>. </p>","globalUniqueId": "1UJBC0BP4T16Y0316","salesPitch": "No Fees, We Will Beat Any Price..

The rear corner bathroom includes a tub/shower and a toilet, with the sink just outside of this room so others can brush their teeth if one is taking a shower before bed. The <strong>outside storage</strong> is accessible on both sides of the unit and will easily allow you bring along camp chairs, yard games and more.  A 16' powered awning with LED lights will create a nice place to gather in the evenings with family and friends!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience.

That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, marine grade exterior speakers, and an on-demand tankless water heater.
