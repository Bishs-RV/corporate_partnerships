<p>Your <strong>family of five or six</strong> will love traveling in this Cougar Sport <strong>lightweight</strong> fifth wheel!  Enter to find a convenient rear kitchen layout just steps inside the door.  Drop your shoes off in the <strong>shoe cubby</strong> to your right at the door, and relax on either the tri-fold sleeper sofa or at the booth dinette.  The sofa and a 12 volt refrigerator are situated within the slide for added roominess.  Head up the steps to a complete bath and private front bedroom featuring a <strong>queen size bed</strong> with dual shirt wardrobes and nightstands on both sides of the bed.  There is also a wardrobe off the foot of the bed along the inside wall with two convenient drawers as well. The bathroom offers a <strong>shower with a skylight</strong> for added headroom and natural lighting.  You will also appreciate the medicine cabinet over the sink for your personal items.  Back down to the main living and kitchen area, a nice size <strong>pantry</strong> will hold all of your dry goods and snacks, and there is ample storage in the overhead cabinets above the dinette on either side of the TV, plus in the kitchen area all along the rear wall.  Here you can cook your family their camp favorites using either the three burner range with oven, or overhead microwave.  Outside, a 17' awning provides added living space protected from the elements!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Cougar Sport structural I-beam frame with <strong>stamped steel cross-members and outriggers</strong>, plus its laminated sidewalls with five-sided aluminum superstructure and <strong>Alpha Super Flex roof membrane</strong> are what active RVers love about the construction of the Cougar line. The Cougar Sport models are no exception when it comes to a great package, as well as being smaller and lighter weight than their big brother Cougar models.  A one-piece, <strong>heated and enclosed polypropylene underbelly</strong> means a longer camping season.  On the inside, residential shaker style hardwood cabinet doors and decorative crown molding, plus seamless pressed countertops and an <strong>on-demand water heater</strong> will make your unit feel even more like home.  You are also sure to appreciate the shiplap style decorative accent wall behind the bed, a porcelain foot flush toilet in the bathroom, plus residential kitchen hardware, and so much more.</p>","globalUniqueId": "4YDFCGK24SV504711","systemCreateDate": "03/18/2025 22:06:00","systemModifyDate": "03/21/2025

Camping</strong></h1> <p>Go Play travel trailers are designed for families and first-time RVers seeking a durable, affordable camper that combines the must-have comforts of home with a feature-packed, family-friendly design. With space-saving layouts and rugged construction, these campers make camping simple, safe, and budget-friendly—so you can focus on having fun in the great outdoors.</p> <p> </p> <p>The 25THW is our toyhauler option for those seeking an adventure-filled weekend with their toys in our Go Play lineup. Get ready to spin those tires on the road, dirt, sand, or anywhere in between with the 25THW</p> <p> </p> <h2>Key Features of the Go Play 25THW</h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Camp-Ready</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>We believe when you purchase an RV it should be Camp-Ready. That’s why every Go Play is equipped with a 200-watt solar package and a heated and enclosed underbelly, so you can enjoy the freedom to camp whenever and wherever adventure takes you. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Built For Durability</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Every Go Play is built with the industry leading Magnum Truss Roof™ system, protecting your RV from damage while you’re camping. The hardwood lumber core cabinets with 70 lb. rated, full extension ball-bearing drawer glides ensure your RV is built with long-lasting durability.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Spacious, Functional Interiors</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>With an 8-foot-wide design and 6'9\" ceilings, the Go Play provides more headroom and living space than many other conventional built travel trailers. Smart storage solutions and added features like coat and towel hooks, and a dedicated wastebasket space make every Go Play interior functional.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Tried and True</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The 10 floor plans in the Go Play lineup cover over 70% of the industry’s best-selling floor plans, meaning you don’t have to worry whether every Go Play is a proven, customer-approved model. By sticking to tried and true floor plans we save on development costs for new designs you might not love—and pass those savings directly to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Super Suite Bedroom (available only in the 20FBS, 22MLS, 26BH, 26BHS, & 26RLS)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The Super Suite bedroom provides a more functional bedroom space. The bed utilizes 2 gas struts to lift, revealing 4 extra drawers, shoe storage, and an open space with a laundry basket to put your dirty laundry underneath the bed.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Western Edition (Suffix “W”)</strong></p> <h2> </h2> <p>Units with a “W” suffix are built at our western plant for customers who crave extended, off-grid adventures. These models come equipped with significantly larger freshwater, gray water, and black water tank capacities—so you can enjoy longer dry camping stays without the need for frequent fill-ups or dump station stops.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Why Choose Go Play?</h2> <p> </p> <p>Go Play was built by people who love camping and designed based on our experience and years of customer feedback. </p> <p> </p> <p>With a Go Play travel trailer, you’ll have everything you need to focus on what matters most—spending time with the people you love and creating memories that last a lifetime.?</p>

Camping</strong></h1> <p>Go Play travel trailers are designed for families and first-time RVers seeking a durable, affordable camper that combines the must-have comforts of home with a feature-packed, family-friendly design. With space-saving layouts and rugged construction, these campers make camping simple, safe, and budget-friendly—so you can focus on having fun in the great outdoors.</p> <p> </p> <p>The 25THW is our toyhauler option for those seeking an adventure-filled weekend with their toys in our Go Play lineup. Get ready to spin those tires on the road, dirt, sand, or anywhere in between with the 25THW</p> <p> </p> <h2>Key Features of the Go Play 25THW</h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Camp-Ready</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>We believe when you purchase an RV it should be Camp-Ready. That’s why every Go Play is equipped with a 200-watt solar package and a heated and enclosed underbelly, so you can enjoy the freedom to camp whenever and wherever adventure takes you. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Built For Durability</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Every Go Play is built with the industry leading Magnum Truss Roof™ system, protecting your RV from damage while you’re camping. The hardwood lumber core cabinets with 70 lb. rated, full extension ball-bearing drawer glides ensure your RV is built with long-lasting durability.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Spacious, Functional Interiors</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>With an 8-foot-wide design and 6'9\" ceilings, the Go Play provides more headroom and living space than many other conventional built travel trailers. Smart storage solutions and added features like coat and towel hooks, and a dedicated wastebasket space make every Go Play interior functional.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Tried and True</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The 10 floor plans in the Go Play lineup cover over 70% of the industry’s best-selling floor plans, meaning you don’t have to worry whether every Go Play is a proven, customer-approved model. By sticking to tried and true floor plans we save on development costs for new designs you might not love—and pass those savings directly to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Super Suite Bedroom (available only in the 20FBS, 22MLS, 26BH, 26BHS, & 26RLS)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The Super Suite bedroom provides a more functional bedroom space. The bed utilizes 2 gas struts to lift, revealing 4 extra drawers, shoe storage, and an open space with a laundry basket to put your dirty laundry underneath the bed.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Western Edition (Suffix “W”)</strong></p> <h2> </h2> <p>Units with a “W” suffix are built at our western plant for customers who crave extended, off-grid adventures. These models come equipped with significantly larger freshwater, gray water, and black water tank capacities—so you can enjoy longer dry camping stays without the need for frequent fill-ups or dump station stops.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Why Choose Go Play?</h2> <p> </p> <p>Go Play was built by people who love camping and designed based on our experience and years of customer feedback. </p> <p> </p> <p>With a Go Play travel trailer, you’ll have everything you need to focus on what matters most—spending time with the people you love and creating memories that last a lifetime.?</p> <p> </p>","globalUniqueId": "58TBPSBN2T77B3106","salesPitch": "2026!!

Camping</strong></h1> <p>Go Play travel trailers are designed for families and first-time RVers seeking a durable, affordable camper that combines the must-have comforts of home with a feature-packed, family-friendly design. With space-saving layouts and rugged construction, these campers make camping simple, safe, and budget-friendly—so you can focus on having fun in the great outdoors.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Key Features of the Go Play 26BHS-G</h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Camp-Ready</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>We believe when you purchase an RV it should be Camp-Ready. That’s why every Go Play is equipped with a 200-watt solar package and a heated and enclosed underbelly, so you can enjoy the freedom to camp whenever and wherever adventure takes you. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Built For Durability</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Every Go Play is built with the industry leading Magnum Truss Roof™ system, protecting your RV from damage while you’re camping. The hardwood lumber core cabinets with 70 lb. rated, full extension ball-bearing drawer glides ensure your RV is built with long-lasting durability.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Spacious, Functional Interiors</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>With an 8-foot-wide design and 6'9\" ceilings, the Go Play provides more headroom and living space than many other conventional built travel trailers. Smart storage solutions and added features like coat and towel hooks, and a dedicated wastebasket space make every Go Play interior functional.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Tried and True</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The 10 floor plans in the Go Play lineup cover over 70% of the industry’s best-selling floor plans, meaning you don’t have to worry whether every Go Play is a proven, customer-approved model. By sticking to tried and true floor plans we save on development costs for new designs you might not love—and pass those savings directly to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Super Suite Bedroom (available only in the 20FBS, 22MLS, 26BH, 26BHS, & 26RLS)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The Super Suite bedroom provides a more functional bedroom space. The bed utilizes 2 gas struts to lift, revealing 4 extra drawers, shoe storage, and an open space with a laundry basket to put your dirty laundry underneath the bed.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Fiberglass Edition (Suffix “G”)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Units with a “G” suffix feature a lightweight, durable fiberglass exterior—offering improved insulation, sleek aesthetics, and minimal maintenance. Enjoy a quieter ride, better temperature regulation, and a long-lasting finish that resists dents and corrosion.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Why Choose Go Play?</h2> <p> </p> <p>Go Play was built by people who love camping and designed based on our experience and years of customer feedback. </p> <p> </p> <p>With a Go Play travel trailer, you’ll have everything you need to focus on what matters most—spending time with the people you love and creating memories that last a lifetime.?</p> <p> </p>","globalUniqueId": "58TBP0BP8S17L3131","salesPitch": "REAR BUNK BEDS!!

designed for families and first-time RVers seeking a durable, affordable camper that combines the must-have comforts of home with a feature-packed, family-friendly design. With space-saving layouts and rugged construction, these campers make camping simple, safe, and budget-friendly—so you can focus on having fun in the great outdoors.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Key Features of the Go Play 22MLSW</h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Camp-Ready</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>We believe when you purchase an RV it should be Camp-Ready. That’s why every Go Play is equipped with a 200-watt solar package and a heated and enclosed underbelly, so you can enjoy the freedom to camp whenever and wherever adventure takes you. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Built For Durability</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Every Go Play is built with the industry leading Magnum Truss Roof™ system, protecting your RV from damage while you’re camping. The hardwood lumber core cabinets with 70 lb. rated, full extension ball-bearing drawer glides ensure your RV is built with long-lasting durability.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Spacious, Functional Interiors</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>With an 8-foot-wide design and 6'9\" ceilings, the Go Play provides more headroom and living space than many other conventional built travel trailers. Smart storage solutions and added features like coat and towel hooks, and a dedicated wastebasket space make every Go Play interior functional.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Tried and True</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The 9 floor plans in the Go Play lineup cover over 70% of the industry’s best-selling floor plans, meaning you don’t have to worry whether every Go Play is a proven, customer-approved model. By sticking to tried and true floor plans we save on development costs for new designs you might not love—and pass those savings directly to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Super Suite Bedroom (available only in the 20FBS, 22MLS, 26BH, 26BHS, & 26RLS)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The Super Suite bedroom provides a more functional bedroom space. The bed utilizes 2 gas struts to lift, revealing 4 extra drawers, shoe storage, and an open space with a laundry basket to put your dirty laundry underneath the bed.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Why Choose Go Play?</h2> <p> </p> <p>Go Play was built by people who love camping and designed based on our experience and years of customer feedback. </p> <p> </p> <p>With a Go Play travel trailer, you’ll have everything you need to focus on what matters most—spending time with the people you love and creating memories that last a lifetime.?</p> <p> </p>","globalUniqueId":

<strong>double-size bunks</strong>, the <strong>RV queen bed</strong> in the front bedroom, plus the booth dinette and jack-knife sofa in the main living area! The chef of your crew will have a three burner cooktop and <strong>microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals, and everyone can store their favorite drinks in the 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator inside, or in the outdoor refrigerator for convenience. The rear corner bathroom includes a tub/shower and a toilet, with the sink just outside of this room so others can brush their teeth if one is taking a shower before bed. The <strong>outside storage</strong> is accessible on both sides of the unit and will easily allow you bring along camp chairs, yard games and more.  A 16' powered awning with LED lights will create a nice place to gather in the evenings with family and friends!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system,</strong> and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, marine grade exterior speakers, and an on-demand <strong>tankless water heater.</strong> </p>","globalUniqueId": "1UJBC0BP3S7ZW0367","systemCreateDate": "04/30/2025 01:53:00","systemModifyDate": "05/05/2025 16:48:00","itemDetailUrl":

Camping</strong></h1> <p>Go Play travel trailers are designed for families and first-time RVers seeking a durable, affordable camper that combines the must-have comforts of home with a feature-packed, family-friendly design. With space-saving layouts and rugged construction, these campers make camping simple, safe, and budget-friendly—so you can focus on having fun in the great outdoors.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Key Features of the Go Play 26BHSW</h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Camp-Ready</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>We believe when you purchase an RV it should be Camp-Ready. That’s why every Go Play is equipped with a 200-watt solar package and a heated and enclosed underbelly, so you can enjoy the freedom to camp whenever and wherever adventure takes you. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Built For Durability</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Every Go Play is built with the industry leading Magnum Truss Roof™ system, protecting your RV from damage while you’re camping. The hardwood lumber core cabinets with 70 lb. rated, full extension ball-bearing drawer glides ensure your RV is built with long-lasting durability.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Spacious, Functional Interiors</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>With an 8-foot-wide design and 6'9\" ceilings, the Go Play provides more headroom and living space than many other conventional built travel trailers. Smart storage solutions and added features like coat and towel hooks, and a dedicated wastebasket space make every Go Play interior functional.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Tried and True</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The 10 floor plans in the Go Play lineup cover over 70% of the industry’s best-selling floor plans, meaning you don’t have to worry whether every Go Play is a proven, customer-approved model. By sticking to tried and true floor plans we save on development costs for new designs you might not love—and pass those savings directly to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Super Suite Bedroom (available only in the 20FBS, 22MLS, 26BH, 26BHS, & 26RLS)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The Super Suite bedroom provides a more functional bedroom space. The bed utilizes 2 gas struts to lift, revealing 4 extra drawers, shoe storage, and an open space with a laundry basket to put your dirty laundry underneath the bed.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Western Edition (Suffix “W”)</strong></p> <h2> </h2> <p>Units with a “W” suffix are built at our western plant for customers who crave extended, off-grid adventures. These models come equipped with significantly larger freshwater, gray water, and black water tank capacities—so you can enjoy longer dry camping stays without the need for frequent fill-ups or dump station stops.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Why Choose Go Play?</h2> <p> </p> <p>Go Play was built by people who love camping and designed based on our experience and years of customer feedback. </p> <p> </p> <p>With a Go Play travel trailer, you’ll have everything you need to focus on what matters most—spending time with the people you love and creating memories that last a lifetime.?</p>

177BHW Sport: Affordable and Practical Camping</strong></h1> <p> </p> <p>The Go Play 177BHW Sport travel trailer is designed to be a more practical and affordable option for families looking to explore the outdoors. The Go Play Sport offers the same trusted quality and essential features that make Go Play great, but in a simplified, budget-friendly package.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Key Features of the Go Play 177BHW Sport</h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Comfortable Amenities:</strong></p> <p>Many budget-friendly travel trailers exclude a propane furnace, replacing it with a less efficient electric heater, and use side-mount AC units that struggle to cool effectively. The Go Play Sport stands out by including a propane furnace and a roof-mounted 13.5k BTU AC, ensuring you stay comfortable while camping.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Built For Durability:</strong></p> <p>Every Go Play is built with the industry leading Magnum Truss Roof™ system, protecting your RV from damage while you’re camping. The hardwood lumber core cabinets with 70 lb. rated, full extension ball-bearing drawer glides ensure your RV is built with long-lasting durability.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Spacious Interior:</strong></p> <p>With an 8-foot-wide body and 6’9” ceilings, the Go Play Sport is wider and taller than most competitive models from other manufacturers. This means the Go Play Sport provides more headroom and living space than many other budget-friendly travel trailers.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Western Edition (Suffix “W”)</strong></p> <p>Units with a “W” suffix are built at our western plant for customers who crave extended, off-grid adventures. These models come equipped with significantly larger freshwater, gray water, and black water tank capacities—so you can enjoy longer dry camping stays without the need for frequent fill-ups or dump station stops.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Why Choose Go Play Sport?</h2> <p>Go Play was built by people who love camping and designed based on our experience and years of customer feedback.</p> <p> </p> <p>With a Go Play Sport travel trailer, you’ll have everything you need at a more affordable price, so you focus on what matters most—spending time with the people you love and creating memories that last a lifetime.</p>","globalUniqueId": "58TBP0AJ4T7763061","systemCreateDate": "09/19/2025 15:02:00","systemModifyDate": "09/17/2025 22:51:00","itemDetailUrl":

and this trailer will provide all the interior comforts you need! There is a three burner cooktop and a<strong> microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals each day, plus an 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator for cold items. After your meal is made, you can dine at the booth dinette or relax on the j<strong>ack-knife sofa</strong>, and these areas can become sleeping space for two to three guests at night. The full bath with a <strong>tub/shower</strong> means you won't have to use the camp's facilities and the <strong>16' power awning</strong> will provide protection from the sun as you visit with other campers!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, marine grade exterior speakers, and an on-demand

Camping</strong></h1> <p>Go Play travel trailers are designed for families and first-time RVers seeking a durable, affordable camper that combines the must-have comforts of home with a feature-packed, family-friendly design. With space-saving layouts and rugged construction, these campers make camping simple, safe, and budget-friendly—so you can focus on having fun in the great outdoors.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Key Features of the Go Play 26BHSW</h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Camp-Ready</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>We believe when you purchase an RV it should be Camp-Ready. That’s why every Go Play is equipped with a 200-watt solar package and a heated and enclosed underbelly, so you can enjoy the freedom to camp whenever and wherever adventure takes you. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Built For Durability</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Every Go Play is built with the industry leading Magnum Truss Roof™ system, protecting your RV from damage while you’re camping. The hardwood lumber core cabinets with 70 lb. rated, full extension ball-bearing drawer glides ensure your RV is built with long-lasting durability.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Spacious, Functional Interiors</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>With an 8-foot-wide design and 6'9\" ceilings, the Go Play provides more headroom and living space than many other conventional built travel trailers. Smart storage solutions and added features like coat and towel hooks, and a dedicated wastebasket space make every Go Play interior functional.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Tried and True</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The 10 floor plans in the Go Play lineup cover over 70% of the industry’s best-selling floor plans, meaning you don’t have to worry whether every Go Play is a proven, customer-approved model. By sticking to tried and true floor plans we save on development costs for new designs you might not love—and pass those savings directly to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Super Suite Bedroom (available only in the 20FBS, 22MLS, 26BH, 26BHS, & 26RLS)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The Super Suite bedroom provides a more functional bedroom space. The bed utilizes 2 gas struts to lift, revealing 4 extra drawers, shoe storage, and an open space with a laundry basket to put your dirty laundry underneath the bed.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Western Edition (Suffix “W”)</strong></p> <h2> </h2> <p>Units with a “W” suffix are built at our western plant for customers who crave extended, off-grid adventures. These models come equipped with significantly larger freshwater, gray water, and black water tank capacities—so you can enjoy longer dry camping stays without the need for frequent fill-ups or dump station stops.</p> <h2> </h2> <h2>Why Choose Go Play?</h2> <p> </p> <p>Go Play was built by people who love camping and designed based on our experience and years of customer feedback. </p> <p> </p> <p>With a Go Play travel trailer, you’ll have everything you need to focus on what matters most—spending time with the people you love and creating memories that last a lifetime.?</p>

The chef of your crew will have a three burner cooktop and <strong>microwave oven</strong> to prepare meals, and everyone can store their favorite drinks in the 8 cu. ft. 12V refrigerator. The bathroom includes a tub/shower and a toilet, with the sink just outside of this room so others can brush their teeth if one is taking a shower before bed. The <strong>outside storage</strong> will let you bring along fishing poles and the 16' power awning with LED lights will create a nice place to gather in the evenings!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Jayco Jay Flight SLX travel trailer is quite easy to own because it is lightweight for an easier towing experience. Built on a <strong>fully integrated A-frame</strong> with galvanized-steel, impact-resistant wheel wells, the Jay Flight SLX has quality at its very foundation. That quality continues on to the electric self-adjusting brakes, easy-lube hubs, <strong>Magnum Truss roof system</strong>, and LP quick connect. Some of what the mandatory Customer Value Package includes is <strong>backup camera prep</strong>, Keyed-Alike entry and baggage doors, marine grade exterior speakers, and an on-demand
